# Created form Component Using React

As my main front end framework, I used React and CSS to customize its styles. I created a simple component to display my home screen style and another to display my form.

The form component contains all the logic for fetching data from the fetch Reward API, displacing it on the form using a for loop, creating an element using HTML, and adding nodes to the element.
